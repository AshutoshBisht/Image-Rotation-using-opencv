# Image-Rotation-using-opencv

## Introduction:
    In this code I have implemented rotation of image at a certain angle using opencv with C++.
    OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis 
    including features like face detection and object detection.
    
## Language Used:
    C++
## Library Used:
    openCV
## software used:
    Visual Studio
## How to run on your PC:
### 1. Installaion of openCV:
        => Installation in Windows:
        you can use the follwing link for documentation to insatll openCV on windows.
             https://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html
   
        => Installation in linux:
            you can use the follwing link for documentation to insatll openCV on linux.
             https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html
             
        =>Installation in macOS:
            you can use the follwing link for documentation to insatll openCV on macOS.
             https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/db2/tutorial_macos_install.html
    
### 2. Installtion of Visual Studio:
        Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web 
        services and mobile apps.
 ### You can check the system requirements here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/system-requirements
        To install visual studio check documentation using the follwing link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019
        
###  To setup openCV with Visual Studio follow the follwing vedio:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDGSkdeV8YI
       
When the whole setup is done open Visual Studio.
    =>Create a new project and then setup openCV for that project.
    
    =>Then paste the code that i have written in Source.cpp in your source file.
    
    =>Then create a images folder in the same folder that contains Source.cpp and put the image that you want to rotate inside that folder.
    
    =>Then
