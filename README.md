# Image-Rotation-using-opencv

## Introduction:
    In this code I have implemented rotation of image at a certain angle using opencv with C++.
    OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis 
    including features like face detection and object detection.
